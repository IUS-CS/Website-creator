# Project Reflections
From this project, I think I have gotten a better understanding of working with a team of indiviuals.  With these  many different sprints, we each got to focus on some part related to the project.  Personally, I beleive I have gotten some decent experience working with html and css aswell.  Along the way, I also got to work on some documentation tasks to help keep the team on track.  Lastly, I believe I got a better understanding of working with the spring framework and how a MVC is setup.

Doing this project has exposed me to new tools and framework that are very important for any aspiring programmers to master. Amongs all this tool, the one that I enjoyed the most is the Spring Framework. I have learnt a lot about java web development by using this framework. I think by doing this project, I have developped a new set of skills and techninques that I will be using from now and I looks forward to learning more and diving deep into the Spring framework.

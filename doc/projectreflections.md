# Project Reflections
From this project, I think I have gotten a better understanding of working with a team of indiviuals.  With these  many different sprints, we each got to focus on some part related to the project.  Personally, I beleive I have gotten some decent experience working with html and css aswell.  Along the way, I also got to work on some documentation tasks to help keep the team on track.  Lastly, I believe I got a better understanding of working with the spring framework and how a MVC is setup.

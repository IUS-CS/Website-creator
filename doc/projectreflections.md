# Project Reflections
From this project, I think I have gotten a better understanding of working with a team of indiviuals.  With these  many different sprints, we each got to focus on some part related to the project.  Personally, I beleive I have gotten some decent experience working with html and css aswell.  Along the way, I also got to work on some documentation tasks to help keep the team on track.  Lastly, I believe I got a better understanding of working with the spring framework and how a MVC is setup.

Doing this project has exposed me to new tools and framework that are very important for any aspiring programmers to master. Amongs all this tool, the one that I enjoyed the most is the Spring Framework. I have learnt a lot about java web development by using this framework. I think by doing this project, I have developped a new set of skills and techninques that I will be using from now and I looks forward to learning more and diving deep into the Spring framework.

Started this project with a idea to learn something which is used in industry while using the knowledge of java gained in school over the years to further the use of knowledge. Working on this project gave me better understanding about MVC and REST. Using a framework for this project gave me glimpse inside the corporate projects. How the project are finished in sprints over the period of time, gathering the research material required to finish the project and learning new framework and IDE and the issues that developers face in day to day life. Learning to use spring MVC was hard and configuring was even harder, but I got better as I kept working and got the big picture of the framework. Also learnt some industry standards while researching about the spring framework. Got a good understanding about estimating time to get the project finished.

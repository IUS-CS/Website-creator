# Script Testing
A big way for for us to test out project will be with postman and using test scripts.  These test run after a request is sent and the response has been received by the server.  We will check to see if the desired status codes are sent when entering in information.

# Manual Testing
This manual testing is quite important when working with HTML and CSS files.  You can watch and see the changes being made, which can help get the overall desired format for the webpages.

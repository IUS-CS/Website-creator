Our project idea is to create a website for a Mediterranean restaurant.  The website will give the customer access to things like a view of menu, the location, popular items, prices, contact info, and address.  

Our goal of this project is simply to create this restuarant menu website and then potentially give it to an actual restaurant in the Louisville area that doesn’t already have one.  With that being said, that will push us a bit harder as we know someone could potentially be using this.

The website will let the user choose the items from the menu for online ordering and dine-in so the orders are ready when the customer arrives to pick up or dine-in.  To put it simply, we want our website to have the capabilities that make it convenient for the customer itself.

When the customer finalizes the order, it adds all the items to the order summary page with a total price that a customer needs to pay at checkout.  The website will also then ask the user to enter the name (Guest Name) and the name is added to the order summary for whenever arriving.

Technical terms
We are planning on using model view controller. We are planning on using angular or jQuery for frontend and java or JavaScript for backend. If we feel it’s beneficial we might use a database like SQL or mongo DB.

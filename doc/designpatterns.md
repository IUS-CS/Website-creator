# Sam Meditteranean Grill Design Patterns

# Command Pattern
The first pattern that is a good fit for making a menu is the command pattern.  The command pattern allows resquests to be encapsulated as objects and this will be utilized when the customer is placing an order.  These orders will then be queued and an alloted message will pop up telling the customer when to come pick up their food.

# Builder Pattern
Another pattern that could work with our restuarant menu is the builder pattern.  If we used this strategy, first we would need some sort of login information or identification when ordering.  This pattern lets the user/clientele build their order from the bottom up and will lead to many unique and different orders which is why an identification will be needed.  

# Module Planning
Our plan moving forward and to really hit hard on this website in the upcoming weeks.  We plan to have a decent website within a month or so that shows off the front end of out website, while also incorporating some of the important functions in the backend that will execute as planned and allow the user to have a good experience when using the website.

#	Sam's Mediterranean Grill
#Our Goal To make a restaurant website menu which contains information like items, prices, location, contact info, etc. Our program is going to make it so you the customer can see the prices and items that you have placed in a cart which will ultimately show the final price at the end. We will also incorporate a function to allow the customer to choose whether they want to dine-in or takeaway. With that being said, once one confirms the order it will prompt them for a name. Overall, we want to make this website easy to use for the customers sake, while still being visually appealing as well.

Tech We will be using Java, SpringMVC, html, css, IntelliJ, and VS Code
